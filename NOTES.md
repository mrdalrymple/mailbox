# Questions

Question: When adding an item to the storage, do we actually want to have to specify an ID?
 - What is that ID really?
 - Could it just be it's first label, and we don't have to store these
packaged under the hood using that ID?
 - What if users uploaded something to the wrong ID and
want to move it?  They could just use remove and add.
 - Note: I'm going to go down one route, but I think this should have another look at (or evolve over time).
